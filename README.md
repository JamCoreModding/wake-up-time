- Press `V` (by default) to trigger an action bar notification that tells you what stage of the day villagers are in, as well as the time until they are next working.
- Use the mods screen (ModMenu on Fabric/Quilt, built-in screen on (Neo)Forge) to edit the config to switch between the keybind toggling the message or showing it once.
